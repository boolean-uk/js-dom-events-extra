# Events Extra
This repository contains some short exercises for those wanting extra practice using events.

## Learning Objectives
- Use `addEventListener` to implement handlers for common DOM events
- Capture user input through the DOM
- Understand when `preventDefault` should be used
- Use the `event` object to access information about DOM events

## Instructions
Open up `index.html` and go through the exercises one part at a time. You can add your JavaScript in the script tag at the end of the document or in a new file, for this exercise it does not matter. You can edit the HTML if you need to (add additional Id's, class names etc.) but it shouldn't be required to complete the exercise.
